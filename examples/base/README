Pyroman "base" configuration files

These are Pyroman example configuration files. Pyroman ships with multiple
sets of configuration examples. This is the "base" example, which contains
rules you are unlikely to do without - they setup the framework in which
Pyroman operates by defining some basic services and such.

Your distribution probably has the configuration examples installed in
/usr/share/doc/pyroman/examples for your reference.

When you run pyroman with the "base" configuration only, the resulting
firewall will reject all connections (including outgoing ones) - there are no
hosts defined, and no "allow" statements in this setup. So it's up to you to
add these!
