Installation:

Copy the contents of the "lib" directory to a location of your choice,
Recommendation: /usr/share/pyroman/ (should be fairly FHS compliant)
and modify the main pyroman command to use this path, so it will find
it's libraries.

Then create your rules in a directory of your choice, for example
/etc/pyroman, and put that path into the pyroman launcher, too.

You can find some example rules in examples/, copy all the basic
files and then have a look at the detailed example and adopt that to
suit your needs.
